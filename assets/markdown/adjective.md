# What is an Adjective?

An **adjective** is a word that tells us **more about a noun**.  
It helps describe **how something or someone looks, feels, smells, behaves**, or even **how many** there are.

In simple words, **adjectives give details** about nouns or pronouns.

### Examples:

- The **red** balloon floated in the sky.  
- She wore a **beautiful** dress.  
- There are **five** oranges on the table.  

In these examples, the words *red*, *beautiful*, and *five* are all adjectives.

# Why Do We Use Adjectives?

Adjectives help us:

- Make our sentences more interesting.
- Describe things more clearly.
- Tell how many, what kind, or which one.

## Without Adjective:
- I have a car.

## With Adjective:
- I have a **fast**, **red** car.

As you can see, adjectives help paint a better picture in the reader's mind.
