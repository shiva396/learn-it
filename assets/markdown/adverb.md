# Adverbs

Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They often answer questions like how, when, where, and to what extent.

## What is an Adverb?

An **adverb** is a word that **modifies** a verb, an adjective, or another adverb.  
It tells us **how**, **when**, **where**, or **to what extent** something happens.

### Examples:

- She runs **quickly**.  
- They arrived **early**.  
- The cat is **very** sleepy.

In each sentence, the adverb gives us more information.
