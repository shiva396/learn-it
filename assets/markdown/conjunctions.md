# Types of Conjunctions

### 1. Coordinating Conjunctions
These join words, phrases, or clauses that are equal in importance.

**Examples:**
- and
- but
- or
- so

**Sentence:**
I wanted to play outside, **but** it started raining.

### 2. Subordinating Conjunctions
These join a dependent clause to an independent clause.

**Examples:**
- because
- although
- if
- when

**Sentence:**
I stayed home **because** it was raining.

---

### 3. Correlative Conjunctions
These work in pairs to join words or phrases.

**Examples:**
- either...or
- neither...nor
- not only...but also

**Sentence:**
**Either** you study hard, **or** you will fail the test.

## Rules to Remember

1. **Use a comma before a coordinating conjunction when joining two independent clauses.**
   - Example: I wanted to play, **but** it was raining.

2. **Subordinating conjunctions often come at the beginning of a dependent clause.**
   - Example: **Because** it was raining, I stayed home.

3. **Correlative conjunctions must always be used in pairs.**
   - Example: **Neither** the teacher **nor** the students were late.
